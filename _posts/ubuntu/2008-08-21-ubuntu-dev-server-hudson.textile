title: Ubuntu Dev. Server - Setting up hudson
category/categories: ubuntu
---

I've decided to switch from using Continuum for Continuous Integration to Hudson.  This is based on a suggestion from a friend.  We'll see how things turn out.

So first, I'm going to list here (because I continually have to look it up) how to install Tomcat5.5 and Apache2 on Ubuntu server and wire the mod_jk forwarding up.

First, install @apache@, @tomcat@ and @mod_jk@
{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install apache2 tomcat5.5 libapache2-mod-jk
{% endhighlight %}

Next create a workers.properties file (mine is in @/etc/apache2/workers.properties@).  Here's what mine looks like:
{% highlight text %}
worker.list=worker1
worker.default.port=8009
worker.default.host=localhost
worker.default.type=ajp13
worker.default.lbfactor=1
{% endhighlight %}

Next, make sure there's a sym-link in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled to /etc/apache2/mods-available/jk.load.

Now that we know mod-jk is loaded on apache startup, it's time to actually set up apache to forward appropriately.  I edited my apache2.conf file (instead of available-hosts/default).  Why?  No real reason.  In fact this should probably be moved into available-hosts/default, but for now I'll just show you the relevant apache configuration to write in the worker you specified above:

{% highlight text %}
# Tomcat Configuration
JkWorkersFile /etc/apache2/workers.properties
JkMount /hudson/* worker1
{% endhighlight %}

Note that I'm only mounting the hudson directory.  This means that I'm only forwarding to tomcat for the tomcat application.  This is because I'm using apache to host my subversion repository AND trac AND hudson (and archiva in the future).

Finally, we have to turn off (or configure) java security for tomcat 5.5 in ubuntu.  I'm turning it off because I'm lazy and I don't plan to place my dev box outside my internal network.  The basic just to turn it off is to open your /etc/init.d/tomcat5.5 file and look for the following line: TOMCAT5_SECURITY=yes.   Change the "yes" to "no" and you should be ready to go.

h3. Installing Hudson

First of, download the hudson war into tomcat's webapps directory - 
{% highlight bash %}
sudo wget http://hudson.gotdns.com/latest/hudson.war
{% endhighlight %}



Next, set up a directory for hudson.  I made one in tomcat's directories:
{% highlight bash %}
cd /var/lib/tomcat5.5
sudo mkdir hudson
sudo chown tomcat5.5 hudson
{% endhighlight %}

Now, you need to add the following line somewhere in the beginning of @/etc/init.d/tomcat5.5@ -
{% highlight bash %}
JAVA_OPTS="${JAVA_OPTS} -DHUDSON_HOME=/var/lib/tomcat5.5/hudson"
{% endhighlight %}

Now, restart tomcat and apache; Hudson should be working at http://youraddress/hudson/
