Well, I was in the SF/Bay Area and gave two talks on SBT while I was there.   Here's the [first](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vED2LMbdFDc), which had a few slide organization issues I corrected before the second (which I hope to post shortly, assuming the video makes it online soon.)  This video is really high quality, so thanks to Markana, Klout and [Michael Slinn](www.twitter.com/mslinn) and the SF Scala meetup folks!

Here's a [copy of the slides](https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dfqn4jb_115x89dq2dg) (updated for the second talk, hopefully it's not confusing).
