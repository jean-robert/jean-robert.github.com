Hey, just thought I'd make an initial post to announce my switch to a statically generated blog site.  Hopefully I can keep the content kicking AND still have neato features like RSS feeds, etc.


The new syte is done in [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and makes it *way* easier for me to write content, so hopefully I'll be doing so more frequently!
