title: What's the state of Jigsaw
---

I hadn't been paying close attention, but recently a [few emails questioning the future of the jigsaw project](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jigsaw-dev/2010-August/001105.html) have been sent to the jigsaw-dev mailing list. The last check-in posted to the mailing list was on June 8th, and was the tail-end of a flurry of check-ins from the jigsaw team.

The whole thing is rather curious, but without any specific word from Oracle, it's all speculation. I have my own guesses, but it's probably best I keep those to myself for now.

### Update ###

It appears that after a few months of inactivity, whatever decisions at Oracle needed to be made were made.   Jigsaw appears to be under active public deveopment again.
