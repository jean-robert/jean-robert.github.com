# Things I intend to work on #

And this would be in mainly in R, maybe combined with Java or Python
* Finishing Flood It implementation
* Radio recorder that automatically cut songs and tag them
* Record temperature to calibrate the heating's on/off time
* Try to use EEG with R
* Try to use Arduino with R (but for what?)

[Contact me](/contact.html) if you have ideas on these
