* Radio recorder that automatically cut songs and tag them
* Record temperature to calibrate the heating's on/off time [(recording is done)](http://jean-robert.github.com/2012/11/11/thermometer-R-using-Arduino-Java.html)
* Try to use EEG with R
* Try to use Arduino with R ([done](http://jean-robert.github.com/2012/11/11/thermometer-R-using-Arduino-Java.html), but looking forward to more)
